The Mud Terminal Type Standard is used to communicate generic terminal
capabilities. The specification is available at:

http://tintin.sourceforge.net/mtts/

The MTTS bitvector will be automatically copied to d->mtts.

MTH 1.5 will automatically handle the NEW-ENVIRON IPADDRESS variable which
is used by mudportal and possibly other proxies to send the real IP address
of the connection.
