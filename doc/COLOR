The xterm 256 color standard has been in existence as of 1999 and is supported
by pretty much all xterm emulating terminals and a large number of MUD clients.

MTH provides a 256 color parser defining 32 distinct colors using ^a to ^Z
codes, as well as codes for using the full 256 color range.

The implementatino is in color.c

Xterm 256 color support is detected using the MTTS standard, and by checking
for the -256color suffix when a client reports its generic terminal type. If
this is the case it sets the COMM_FLAG_256COLORS bitflag on the
d->mth->comm_flags bitvector.


        For xterm true color foreground colors use <F000> to <FFFF>
        For xterm true color background colors use <B000> to <BFFF>

        With true colors disabled colors are converted to xterm 256 colors.

        With 256 colors disabled colors are converted to 16 color ANSI.

        With 16 colors disabled color codes are stripped.

        4096 colors are a maximum of 16 bytes.
        256 colors are a maximum of 11 bytes.
        16 colors are a maximum of 8 bytes.

        For MUD 32 color codes use:

        ^a - dark azure                 ^A - azure
        ^b - dark blue                  ^B - blue
        ^c - dark cyan                  ^C - cyan
        ^e - dark ebony                 ^E - ebony
        ^g - dark green                 ^G - green
        ^j - dark jade                  ^J - jade
        ^l - dark lime                  ^L - lime
        ^m - dark magenta               ^M - magenta
        ^o - dark orange                ^O - orange
        ^p - dark pink                  ^P - pink

        ^v - dark violet                ^V - violet
        ^w - dark white                 ^W - white
        ^y - dark yellow                ^Y - yellow
