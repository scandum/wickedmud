Whenever Windows telnet receives a telnet negotiation it will automatically
switch itself to character mode, which effectively kills local echo, with no
means of disabling it remotely.

MTH will automatically detect Windows telnet and set COMM_FLAG_REMOTEECHO
and handle the remote echo for you.

MTH will also set COMM_FLAG_PASSWORD when using the echo_on() and echo_off()
functions to print a * instead of the actual character.
