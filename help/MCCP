The Mud Client Compression Protocol has the purpose of reducing the
bandwidth usage of the mudserver, by using an MCCP-complient mudclient,
the data send to you will be compressed by 80-85%, and thus not only
reducing the amount of data processed by the server, but also greatly
reduces the amount of data you need to download (i.e. less lag for you).

This MUD supports version 2 and 3 of the compression protocol.

MCCP was created by Oliver Jowett
